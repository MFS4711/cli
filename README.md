## Aim of Project
This proect was completed in order to understand how to use git and how this can be a very effective tool in version control of the task being undertaken. Not only was I able to learn about how I would save projects to a directory but also about how to retrieve previous work. Further to this, I was able to discover how to put files in a file to be ignored so multiple files could be saved at once.

## Git commands
- git init - to activate git
- ls - shows files in directory but not hidden ones
- ls - a = shows all files in directory including hidden
- echo “.....” >> ….(file type) = creates file with text in quotation with file name specified
- git status - shows which files are untracked and changes required to fix
- git add ….. (file name) - this adds the workspace to staging area
- git commit -m “....” (word or phrase to represent changes) (initial commit) = updates log as a change has been made
- git push - is like publishing the project files onto github - usually done at the end of a project but can be done for unfinished versions.
- git log - to view previous commit updates - can use this to load previous versions of the project and continue from a new point
- git rm --cached …… (file name) - used to remove a file that has been wrongly added to the staging area
- git diff …..(file name) - allows us to see difference between current file and previous commited version
- git reset --hard ……(part of SHA) - allows us to revert to a previous version of the project using SHA checksum found in the log
- echo “.....(file name)” >> .gitignore - adds file to be ignored onto ignore list - so allowing multiple files to be saved at once ignoring these files

## Technologies used
I have used Git and GitHub to achieve the learning described above.
